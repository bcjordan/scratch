The included ScratchXO.image and ScratchXO.changes source code files reflect modifications made to Scratch 1.4 for compatiblility with the Sugar User interface for OLPC. This source code is licensed under Gnu General Public License version 2.0. See the included gpl-2.0.txt.

Many thanks to Bert Freudenbert and Claudia Urrea, without whose hard work and dedication Scratch would still lack Journal support. Thanks to Derek O'Connell for his work on Squeak sound issues, and the plugin support for the camera and Lego WeDo.

Current XO Scratch limitations:

  o The note and drum blocks are simulated in Squeak; all instruments and drums sound the same
  o No support for mesh networking
  o Does not follow the Sugar UI guidelines
  o Cannot import mp3 audio files
